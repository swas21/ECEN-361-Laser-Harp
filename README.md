# Laser Harp
## Overview
The *Laser Harp* is our final project for our ECEN 361 (Embedded System) course. The basic idea is that when a user breaks or "plucks" a string a note of a corresponding frequency is played. 

This project requires a basic real time operating system (RTOS), different types of inputs and outputs, utlizing common peripharal communction standards, and basic introductions to digtal signal processing (DSP).
